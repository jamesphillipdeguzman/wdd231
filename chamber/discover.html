                <p class="img-desc">The Old Iloilo Prison Building, constructed in 1911, served as a prison until 2006
                    when operations moved to a new facility in Pototan. In 2018, the building was repurposed as the
                    Western Visayas Regional Museum after renovations funded by the local government and the National
                    Museum. Recognized as a National Cultural Treasure, the museum now features five galleries that
                    showcase the rich culture of Western Visayas, highlighting its architectural and historical
                    significance.
